## AutoFormatter
Thing used to replace & update the headers/footers of lots of html files at once.
Works by locating  
\<div class='content'>  
and  
\<div class='footer'>  
then copying the data found between those tags, as well as special data like title tags.
Wipes document, writes in new header, writes in copied data, then writes in new footer, while filling in the special data along the way.

## TkinterMinesweeper
A recreation of minesweeper using the Tkinter package.  
It works, sorta.

## ParseCSSJunk / ParseHTMLJunk
An attempt at sorting out CSS/HTML code that's had its linebreaks and indentation removed.  
Sometimes works, but has been breaking lately so I dunno.

## NovaBot
Bot project for the Discord server I hang out in.  
Does fun stuff like ship users, manage server currency, sets timers, and a bunch of useful admin stuff.
